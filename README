== Introduction

Passenger is an Apache module for Ruby on Rails support.

Since it hasn't been released yet, if you're reading this, then you must be a
beta tester. :) We only ask of you not to give out this software to others.
Even though it's going to be open source, we want the first release to leave a
good impression. And with good, we mean GREAT.

We're pretty confident that the current version is pretty stable: we have lots
of tests, and we've even tested the insertion of random errors, and so far we
haven't been able to make it crash. But we're not done yet, and there is a lot
more to test before we're confident enough that it can be released to the
public. Leaking an unstable beta will influence peoples' first impression, so
we prefer to prevent that.

Thank you for your understanding.

== Installation

Run the script ./bin/passenger-install-apache2-module

This README will not give you any further instructions. The idea is that the
installation should be so simple, that the above one-liner is enough
instructions. If you encounter any problems, please tell us.

== Known issues

- The default Apache as provided by MacOS X seems to be broken.
  Passenger does not work on it. OS X users are recommended to install
  Apache manually.
