This installer will guide you through the entire installation process. It
shouldn't take more than 3 minutes in total.

Here's what you can expect from the installation process:

 #{bold('1.')} The Apache 2 module will be automatically installed for you.
 #{bold('2.')} This installer will teach you how to configure Apache.
 #{bold('3.')} This installer will teach you how to deploy a Ruby on Rails application.
 #{bold('4.')} There is no step 4.

Don't worry if anything goes wrong. This installer will advise you on how to
solve the problem.

	You seem to be running MacOS X. Testers have reported that the default Apache
	installation, as provided by MacOS X, is broken. Passenger seems to crash for
	unknown reasons on OS X's default Apache installation.
	
	And it seems that you are about to install Passenger against OS X's default
	Apache installation (/usr/sbin/apxs).
	
	We recommend you to install Apache manually, and to install Passenger against
	that Apache instead. To tell Passenger to use a different Apache installation,
	please set the #{bold('APXS2')} environment variable, and run this installer again.
	For example, if Apache is installed in /opt/apache2, then please set:
	
	  APXS2=/opt/apache2/bin/apxs
	    -or-
	  APXS2=/opt/apache2/bin/apxs2
	
	...depending on whether your Apache installation's apxs is called 'apxs' or
	'apxs2'.
