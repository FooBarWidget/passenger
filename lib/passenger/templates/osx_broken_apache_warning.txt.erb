You seem to be running MacOS X. Testers have reported that the default Apache
installation, as provided by MacOS X, is broken. Passenger seems to crash for
unknown reasons on OS X's default Apache installation.

And it seems that you are about to install Passenger against OS X's default
Apache installation (/usr/sbin/apxs).

We recommend you to install Apache manually, and to install Passenger against
that Apache instead. To tell Passenger to use a different Apache installation,
please set the <b>APXS2</b> environment variable, and run this installer again.
For example, if Apache is installed in /opt/apache2, then please set:

  APXS2=/opt/apache2/bin/apxs
    -or-
  APXS2=/opt/apache2/bin/apxs2

...depending on whether your Apache installation's apxs is called 'apxs' or
'apxs2'.

<b>Press Enter if you want to install Passenger against OS X's default Apache.</b>
<b>Press Ctrl-C to abort this installer.</b>
