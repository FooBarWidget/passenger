<banner>Deploying a Ruby on Rails application: an example</banner>

Suppose you have a Ruby on Rails application in <b>/somewhere</b>. Add a virtual host
to your Apache configuration file, and set its DocumentRoot to
<b>/somewhere/public</b>, like this:
<b>
   <VirtualHost *:80>
      ServerName www.yourhost.com
      DocumentRoot /somewhere/public
   </VirtualHost>
</b>
And that's it! You may also want to check the Users Guide for security and
